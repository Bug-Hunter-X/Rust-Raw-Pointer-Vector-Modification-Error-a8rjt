This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming:  unsafe manipulation of vectors using raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file showcases incorrect usage, leading to potential memory corruption.  The corrected version, `bugSolution.rs`, demonstrates a safer alternative using standard vector methods.
